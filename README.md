I have a little raspberry pi camera and tried using ansible to automate the setup.

The playbook works, though host name and motion download link are currently hardcoded unfortunately. 
The setup steps are basically just taken from the [motioneye wiki](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki/Install-On-Raspbian)
and translated to a playbook, so I can learn some superficial ansible.
